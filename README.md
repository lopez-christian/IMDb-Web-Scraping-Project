# Flatiron School Module 1 Project: IMDb Web Scraping 

## Data Scraping the TOP 250 movies of all-time in IMDb. Initially sorted by number of votes in descending order. 

This project incorporates some data scraping, data wrangling, data cleaning, and visualizations.

## Example of dataframe:

This project makes use of various modules including beautifulsoup, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy. 
Below is the dataframe that is created displaying the relevant information we need to create the visualizations and explorations.

## Purpose of project: 

The purpose was to explore the data within IMDB's TOP 250 movies of all-time and determine if there were any meaninful conclusions I could derive from such. I was looking for any correlations between the features I scraped that would eventually be used to drive my visualizations. 

## Questions: 

- How does the spread of genre in terms of metascore look for each title in the dataset?
- What genre appears to be most promising for a company that wants to break into the film-making industry?
- What actors and directors fare best in said genre? And how do they compare amongst each other? 
- Are there any meaninful correlations or relationships to look at that might give us a little more insight into the film-making industry?

## Findings:

The action genre seems to be most promising in terms of breaking into the industry. The spread represents many more data points then do the other genres. Although action doesn't have the films with the highest metascores, they are represented much more amongst the films in the TOP 250 IMDb movies of all-time. If a company decided to go ahead and produce an action-packed film their chances of making it into the TOP 250 would be much greater than if they were to go with any other genre. 

* *-Sidenote: If a company decided to go ahead and make a horror film or western film, they would have to execute and exceptional film with an extremely high metascore in order to have any remote chance of making it into the TOP 250* *
