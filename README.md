# Purpose of project:

The purpose of the project was to explore the data within IMDb's TOP 250 films of all-time and determine if there were any meaninful conlcusions I could derive from such. I was looking for any correlaitons between the features I scraped that would eventually be used to drive my visualizations. 

# Questions/Answers:

- What genre appears to be the most promising for the company that wants to break-into the film-making industry?

The action genre seems to be the most promising in terms of breaking into film industry. The spread represents many more data points then do the other genres. Although action doesn't have the films with the highest metascores, they are represented much more amongst the films in the TOP 250 IMDb movies of all-time. If a company decided to go ahead and produce an action-packed film, their chances of making it into the TOP 250 would be much greater than if they were to go with any other genre. 

* *Sidenote: If a company decided to go ahead and make a horror film or western film, they would have to execute an exceptional film with an extremely high metascore in order to have any remote chance of making it into the TOP 250.* 

- What directors and actors fare best in said genre? And how do they compare amongst each other?

The director that seems to garner the most votes in the action genre appears to be Christopher Nolan when looking at the TOP 20 action films. The Dark Knight is his most successful film with almost double the votes compared to his other films. James Cameron comes in second with Avatar amassing around 1.08 million votes. It'd be smart for the company to hedge their bets and hire Christopher Nolan as their producer if they aspire to break in. 



- Are there any meaningful correlations/relationships to look at that might provide more insight into the film-making industry?
