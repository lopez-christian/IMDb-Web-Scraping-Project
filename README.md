## Purpose of project: 

The purpose was to explore the data within IMDB's TOP 250 movies of all-time and determine if there were any meaninful conclusions I could derive from such. I was looking for any correlations between the features I scraped that would eventually be used to drive my visualizations. 

## Questions: 

How does the spread of genre in terms of metascore look for each title in the dataset?
What genre appears to be most promising for a company that wants to break into the film-making industry?
What actors and directors fare best in said genre? And how do they compare amongst each other? 
Are there any meaninful correlations or relationships to look at that might give us a little more insight into the film-making industry?
